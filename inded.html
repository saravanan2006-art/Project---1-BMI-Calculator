    <p id="para">Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple numerical measure used to assess whether a person’s body weight is appropriate for their height. 
        It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. BMI is widely used as a screening tool to categorize individuals as underweight, 
        normal weight, overweight, or obese, and it helps indicate potential health risks related to body weight. Although BMI is easy to calculate and useful for general assessment, 
        it does not directly measure body fat and does not account for factors such as muscle mass, age, or gender.
         Therefore, while BMI is helpful for identifying possible weight-related health concerns, it should not be considered a definitive diagnostic measure.

        <p id="below">For individuals <span class="spn">below 18 years of age</span>, BMI is not interpreted using fixed ranges as it is for adults. Instead, 
        it is evaluated using BMI-for-age percentiles, which take into account <span class="spn">age and sex</span>, because children and adolescents are still growing 
        and their body composition changes over time. The BMI value is first calculated using the same formula (weight divided by height squared), 
        but the result is then compared against standardized growth charts. Based on the percentile, a child is classified as underweight (below the 5th percentile),
         healthy weight (5th to less than the 85th percentile), overweight (85th to less than the 95th percentile), or obese (95th percentile or above). 
         This percentile-based approach provides a more accurate assessment of growth patterns and health risk in children and teenagers than adult BMI categories.
